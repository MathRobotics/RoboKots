# Developer Tools

This directory contains local benchmark and investigation tools. These tools are
not part of RoboKots' normal runtime path.

## Install Developer Dependencies

Pinocchio is optional and is not installed with the default RoboKots
dependencies. To install the developer extra with `uv`:

```bash
uv sync --extra developer
```

For pip-based editable installs:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[developer]"
```

The Pinocchio Python package is distributed on PyPI as `pin`, but it is imported
from Python as `pinocchio`.

## Benchmarks

All performance and comparison scripts live in `developer/benchmarks`.

Run the regular runtime benchmark:

```bash
uv run python -m developer.benchmarks.runtime
```

The printed baseline values are machine- and dependency-version specific. Use
them as a rough reference only unless the CPU, Python, NumPy, JAX, and power
settings match the baseline environment.

Run the batch API benchmark:

```bash
uv run python -m developer.benchmarks.batch_api
```

Run the high-DOF RoboKots baseline:

```bash
uv run python -m developer.benchmarks.robokots_baseline
```

Run Jacobian comparison and DOF sweep utilities:

```bash
uv run python -m developer.benchmarks.jacobian_compare
uv run python -m developer.benchmarks.jacobian_dof_sweep
```

Run the optional Pinocchio comparison:

```bash
uv run --extra developer python -m developer.benchmarks.pinocchio_compare
```

If Pinocchio is not installed, the comparison script exits with a skip message.
The comparison measures runtime categories on generated models with the same
topology; it is not a strict numerical equivalence test for RoboKots CMTM
outputs.
